I developed this project in my first semester after learning C programming language. This project is called "Typing Tutor" which is a console based C project.
Typing Tutor helps users improve their typing accuracy and speed. Itâ€™s a practical application that helped me combine concepts like file handling, loops, conditional statements, and time measurement into a complete working program.
The program helps users practice and improve their typing accuracy and speed, offering two difficulty levels (Easy and Difficult). It reads sentences from external files (easy.txt / difficult.txt), validates user input in real time, and provides performance statistics.

The program tracks:
a. Accuracy (%)
b. Typing speed (Words Per Minute)
c. Mistake count
d. Elapsed time

It also allows users to save and view their performance summaries in a "progress.txt" file for later review.

Features:
1. Two difficulty levels for practice.
2. Real-time validation with sound feedback for mistakes.
3. Calculates Accuracy (%), Typing Speed (WPM), and Mistake Count.
4. Tracks and saves progress in progress.txt for future review.
5. Demonstrates file handling, string manipulation, loops, conditional logic, and time measurement in C.
